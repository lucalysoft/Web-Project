Working with Databases
======================

> Note: This section is under development.

In this section, we will describe how to create a new page to display data fetched from a database table.
To achieve this goal, you will create an [action](structure-controllers.md), a [view](structure-views.md),
and an [Active Record](db-active-record.md) model that can be used to fetch and represent database data.

Through this tutorial, you will learn

* How to configure database connections;
* How to define an Active Record class;
* How to query data using the Active Record class;
* How to display data in a view in a paginated fashion.
