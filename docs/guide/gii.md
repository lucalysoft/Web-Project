The Gii code generation tool
============================

Yii2 includes a handy tool that allows rapid prototyping by generating commonly used code snippets
as well as complete CRUD controllers.

Installing and configuring
--------------------------

Add these lines to your config file:

```php
'modules' => [
	'gii' => ['yii\gii\Module']
]
```

How to use it
-------------

TBD

> Note: The code generated by gii is only a template that has to be adjusted to your needs. It is there
  to help you create new things quickly but it is not something that creates ready to use code.
  We often see people using the models generated by gii without change and just extend them to adjust
  some parts of it. This is not how it is ment to be used. Code generated by gii may be incomplete or incorrect
  and has to be changed to fit your needs before you can use it.

Creating your own templates
---------------------------

TBD
