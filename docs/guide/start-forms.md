Working with Forms
==================

> Note: This section is under development.

In this section, we will describe how to create a new page to get data from users.
The page will display a form with a name input field and an email input field.
After getting the data entered by a user, the page will echo them back to the user for confirmation.

To achieve this goal, besides creating an [action](structure-controllers.md) and
two [views](structure-views.md), you will also create a [model](structure-models.md).

Through this tutorial, you will learn

* How to create a [model](structure-models.md) to represent the data entered by users;
* How to declare rules to validate the data entered by users;
* How to build an HTML form in a [view](structure-views.md).
